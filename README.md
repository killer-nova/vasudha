# Emotional AI â€” Vasudha 2025 Science Project

## Project Overview

**Emotional AI** is an experimental web-based system designed for the Vasudha 2025 science exhibition. This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and human emotion, demonstrating how modern algorithms can detect, interpret, and respond to the emotional tone of user input in real time.

The application features a visually immersive chat interface, styled in deep navy and black, that simulates empathetic conversation. By analyzing the language and sentiment of each message, the AI attempts to infer the user's emotional state and generate contextually appropriate, supportive responses.

## Scientific Goals

- Investigate the ability of AI to recognize and classify human emotions from text.
- Demonstrate real-time, emotion-aware dialogue between humans and machines.
- Explore the impact of empathetic AI responses on user experience and perceived support.
- Provide a platform for further experimentation in affective computing and natural language understanding.

## Features

- **Emotion Detection:** Uses advanced keyword and sentiment analysis to infer user emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, confusion, etc.).
- **Empathetic Dialogue:** AI generates responses tailored to the detected emotion, aiming to comfort, encourage, or celebrate with the user.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive, accessible, and visually appealing interface for all devices.
- **Customizable:** Easily modify emotion logic, UI theme, or response style for further experiments.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Configure the AI:**
   - Open `src/App.jsx` and set your API key in the `fetchAIResponse` function (for demonstration purposes, a key is already included).
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Customization & Experimentation

- Modify the emotion detection logic in `src/App.jsx` to test new hypotheses or add more nuanced emotional categories.
- Adjust the UI in `src/index.css` for different visual effects or accessibility needs.
- Experiment with different prompt styles to observe changes in AI empathy and response quality.

## Scientific Context

This project is inspired by research in affective computing, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. It aims to provide a hands-on demonstration of how machines can be designed to better understand and support human emotions, with potential applications in mental health, education, and digital companionship.

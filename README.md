# 💡 Emotional AI – Vasudha 2025 Science Exhibition

> *"Can machines understand feelings?"*  
> This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and emotion to create empathetic conversations between humans and machines.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**Emotional AI** is an experimental, web-based chatbot designed for **Vasudha 2025**, showcasing how modern AI can detect and respond to human emotions in real time.  
Using natural language processing (NLP), the system interprets user input, identifies emotional cues, and responds with empathetic messages tailored to the user's mood.

The interface is styled with a deep navy and black theme, simulating a calming, immersive environment for emotional interaction.

---

## 🎯 Scientific Goals

- Analyze how AI can detect emotional tone from user text.
- Demonstrate real-time, emotion-aware conversations.
- Evaluate how empathetic AI responses affect user comfort and engagement.
- Serve as a foundation for future studies in **affective computing** and **human-computer empathy**.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Emotion Detection**: Basic keyword and sentiment analysis to infer emotions like **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **confused**, and more.
- 🤖 **Empathetic Responses**: The AI adjusts its tone to support, comfort, or celebrate with the user.
- 🎨 **Modern Interface**: Clean, responsive design that works across desktop and mobile.
- 🔧 **Customizable**: Easily tweak emotion logic, response behavior, or theme for experimentation.

# Emotional AI â€” Vasudha 2025 Science Project

Welcome to my science project for Vasudha 2025! This website, titled **Emotional AI**, demonstrates an innovative AI that detects the user's emotion, understands their tone, and responds empathetically.

This is a Vite + React prototype designed for the Vasudha 2025 exhibition. The site features a modern navy blue and blackish theme, and a chat interface powered by the OpenAI API (API key stored in a .env file).

## Features
- Modern, visually appealing UI (navy blue/black theme)
- Chat interface that analyzes user emotion and tone
- Connects to OpenAI API for empathetic responses
- Easy to configure with your own API key in `.env`

## Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root with your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Customization
- Update the chat logic in `src/App.jsx` to enhance emotion detection and response.
- Change theme colors in the styled-components or CSS.
